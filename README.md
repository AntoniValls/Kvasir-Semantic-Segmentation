# Kvasir-SEG polyp segmentation using U-Net based models
This project focuses on semantic segmentation for the Vision and Cognitive Systems course at UNIPD.

## Dataset

The Kvasir-SEG dataset used in this project can be accessed here: https://datasets.simula.no/kvasir/.

## Models

This repository contains the implementation of the following models:
* Attention UNet
* UNet++

Additionally, the final project includes benchmark models such as U-Net and ResUNet, implemented by a colleague (code not included in this repository).

## Results

Our experiments demonstrate that UNet++ with augmented data and deep supervision outperforms all other models.
