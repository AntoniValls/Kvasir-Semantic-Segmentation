The files are too heavy to be uploaded here. What I did in my computer was to download the files from the drive to my computer.

Then, there is a folder called "data" with the folders/files:
- augmented (folder)    # where data augmented numpys are saved
- images (folder)       # original images
- masks (folder)        # original masks
- kavsir_bboxes.json     # original boxes file
